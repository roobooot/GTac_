> Abstract—Dexterity and tactile sensing have been the key
challenges for robotic grippers to interact with everyday objects
of various shapes and sizes, such as grasping and manipulation.
A reconfigurable mechanism with a multi-fingered
design enables grippers to perform multiple grasping gestures
for different objects. Moreover, tactile feedback is needed to
facilitate the grasping and manipulation tasks for a larger range
of objects with closed-loop control. Therefore, it is crucial to
develop a reconfigurable multi-fingered gripper with integrated
tactile sensing capabilities. In this letter, we present a robotic
gripper with a reconfigurable mechanism and biomimetic tactile
sensors integrated into the fingers and palm. Our gripper with
four adaptive fingers can perform 5 grasping gestures and
obtain 228 tactile feedback signals (normal and shear forces) in
150 Hz. We show that the gripper can grasp various everyday
objects and achieve in-hand manipulation including translation
and rotation with closed-loop control. This research provides a
new hardware design and could be beneficial to various robotic
applications in the domestic and industrial fields.
