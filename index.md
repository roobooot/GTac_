> Abstract—Human hands can effectively perform daily activities, such as grasping 
and handovers of fragile objects, utilizing the tactile sensing 
capabilities which simultaneously perceive normal and shear forces 
via the mechanoreceptors highly integrated into the fingers and palm; 
here, human somatosensory systems leverage complex tactile feedback 
into patterns and identify the extrinsic contact states (ECSs) of objects 
in contact-rich tasks. Similarly, these features are still open issues and 
critical for robots in acquiring such human skills. In this letter, we integrate 
GTac sensors into a robotic hand, GTac-Hand, to obtain tactile feedback from its 
fingers and palm, resulting in 285 tactile measurements. Our results show that 
GTac-Hand can grasp delicate objects and precisely identify their ECSs via human-like
patterning and learning models, which can be used for robots to perform challenging 
tasks, such as delicate object grasping, object handovers, and ball-hit recognition.
