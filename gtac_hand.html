<p>Abstractâ€”Human hands can effectively perform daily activities,
such as grasping and handovers of fragile objects,
utilizing the tactile sensing capabilities which simultaneously
perceive normal and shear forces via the mechanoreceptors
highly integrated into the fingers and palm; here, human
somatosensory systems leverage complex tactile feedback into
patterns and identify the extrinsic contact states (ECSs) of
objects in contact-rich tasks. Similarly, these features are still
open issues and critical for robots in acquiring such human
skills. In this letter, we integrate GTac sensors into a robotic
hand, GTac-Hand, to obtain tactile feedback from its fingers
and palm, resulting in 285 tactile measurements. Our results
show that GTac-Hand can grasp delicate objects and precisely
identify their ECSs via human-like patterning and learning
models, which can be used for robots to perform challenging
tasks, such as delicate object grasping, object handovers, and</p>
